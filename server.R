          in human history. Is it actually the end though? While this development brings hope, we must 
          remain vigilant given the ongoing cases of infection and the continued vaccination efforts. 
          We are interested in understanding the true impact of COVID-19, specifically by exploring the 
          effectiveness of vaccination at the state level, the distribution of medical resources, and the 
          comprehensive coverage of healthcare services. Some main questions we are center on includes:")

    The Our World in Data team collected and updated the vaccination data daily depending on the most recent
    data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and estimated the population data
    from the last revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. The data was collected under the
    motivation of making the existing research and data accessible and understandable, providing a 
    comprehensive perspective on global living conditions, and achieving more progress people are capable of. 
    The dataset has 53,733 rows of observations and 16 columns including date, location, people_vaccinated, 
    people_fully_vaccinated, and people_vaccinated_per_hundred, etc.. Some differences of the population 
    between the number in the dataset and the ones reported by the government could be observed due to various 
    differences in measures. The population in our dataset uses the total population in each state, while the 
    official data reports the vaccination coverage as the percentage of eligible individuals who have been 
    vaccinated, which typically refers only to adult population. In addition, clinical trials participants on 
    the vaccine arm are excluded since such data is largely unavaliable especially for the ongoing trials.")

          Shiny app on COVID vaccination data in the US. One of the most significant challenges that we may 
          run into is data quality and reliability. The vaccination data can be complex, messy, and may not 
          always be up-to-date, so it is important to have a reliable source of data to ensure the accuracy 
          of our appâ€™s output. Additionally, the data may have different levels of precision depending on the 
          source, which can impact how we visualize and analyze the data. Another challenge is data privacy 
          and security. As vaccination data is sensitive and sometimes protected information, we will need to 
          ensure that we comply with data privacy regulations and protect user data when developing our app. 
          Furthermore, developing a Shiny app requires some programming skills, and we need to make sure we 
          have a good understanding of the R programming language to build a functional and interactive app. 
          Finally, the success of our Shiny app may also depend on the availability of the data and the speed
          at which it is updated. We must ensure that our app can handle real-time data and provide timely 
          insights to our users.")
